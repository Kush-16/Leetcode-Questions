In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.
Example 1:
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        
        dict1= {}
        for x,y in enumerate(order):
            dict1[y] = x  # {h:0, l:1, a:2, b:3, .....}
            
        for i in range(len(words)-1):
            word1 = words[i]
            word2 = words[i+1] #comparing the first two words given in the list
            
            for j in range(min(len(word1),len(word2))):
                if word1[j] != word2[j]:   #checking if the alphabets of the two words in the list are same or not... 
                    if dict1[word1[j]] > dict1[word2[j]]: #if not same, then we check their numeric value in the dictionary 
                        return False
                    break
            else:
                if len(word1) > len(word2): # if the length of first word is more.. then obviously return false
					return False
                    
        return True
